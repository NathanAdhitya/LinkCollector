# LinkCollector
a chrome extension that was made for the sole purpose of making life easier by being able to add links to a list and then copy and paste the entire list quick enough.

# usage
right click on a link and add to link list, then you can view the *current* links in your ram by opening up the popup from the extension icon.

# background of why i made this
because life just became easier when you need to download specific things in a page and not needing to keep copying and pasting to your download manager.
